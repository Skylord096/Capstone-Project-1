        "Understanding the variables (columns) in the `airbnb_df` DataFrame is crucial for conducting effective exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deriving insights from the dataset. Let's briefly discuss each variable and its potential significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **id**: Unique identifier for each Airbnb listing. This variable can be useful for referencing specific listings or joining with other datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **name**: Title or description of the Airbnb listing. While this variable provides textual information about the listing, it may not be directly relevant for quantitative analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **host_id**: Unique identifier for the host of the listing. This variable allows us to identify listings associated with each host and potentially analyze host behavior or performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **host_name**: Name of the host. Similar to the `name` variable, this variable provides information about the host but may not have a direct impact on quantitative analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **neighbourhood_group**: Grouping of neighborhoods (boroughs) in New York City. This categorical variable can be useful for analyzing spatial patterns and comparing listings across different neighborhoods.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **neighbourhood**: Specific neighborhood where the Airbnb listing is located. Like `neighbourhood_group`, this variable provides spatial information that can be used for geographic analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **latitude** and **longitude**: Coordinates of the listing's location. These numerical variables are essential for geospatial analysis and visualization, allowing us to plot listings on maps and identify spatial patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **room_type**: Type of room available for rent (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room). This categorical variable provides information about the accommodation type and can be used for segmentation and analysis based on room type.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **price**: Price per night for the listing. This numerical variable is a key metric for analyzing pricing trends, identifying outliers, and understanding the distribution of prices across listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **minimum_nights**: Minimum number of nights required for booking. This numerical variable provides information about booking restrictions and can be useful for understanding host policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **number_of_reviews**: Total number of reviews for the listing. This numerical variable reflects the popularity and level of engagement with the listing, which can be indicative of listing quality and guest satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **last_review**: Date of the last review. This temporal variable provides information about the recency of reviews and can be useful for analyzing trends over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **reviews_per_month**: Average number of reviews per month. This numerical variable complements `number_of_reviews` by providing a normalized measure of review activity over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **calculated_host_listings_count**: Number of listings managed by the host. This numerical variable provides insights into host activity and scale of operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **availability_365**: Number of days the listing is available for booking within the next year. This numerical variable reflects listing availability and can be useful for analyzing booking patterns and seasonality.\n",
